# tidycensus

Scripts for retrieving and processing American Community Survey data into a format usable by PowerBI. 

These scripts use the tidycensus R package to retrieve ACS data and, when needed, pivot it, calculate new columns, rename columns, and get it into a (usually wide) format useful for Power BI.

The scripts call data for Pierce, King, and Snohomish Counties of Washington State, but this can be easily modified.
